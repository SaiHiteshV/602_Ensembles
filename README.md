- The Accuracy of support vector model is 66.48%
- The ROC socre of the ensembled model is 73.39% which is higher than the logitic regression, decision tree, support vector models.
- The ROC socre of AdaBoost is 64.1% which is greater than that of decision tree model, but less than logistic regression and support vector model.
